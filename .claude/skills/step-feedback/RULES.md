# Reader-step rules

The active house style for course-reader steps. **Read all of it before writing
or editing a step.** Every rule here came from the owner reacting to a real
step, except the seeds marked *(inherited)* — those come from `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
and the memory index and are restated here only because they bite hardest in
reader steps.

Ids are stable. A withdrawn rule is struck through, never deleted.

## W — Writing

- **W-1** *(inherited)* Banned words: tapestry, nuance, multifaceted, robust,
  delve, foster, Furthermore, It's worth noting, landscape, journey, empower,
  leverage (as a verb), game-changer, seamless, holistic, synergy.
- **W-2** *(inherited)* Make the point and stop. No padding, no restating the
  section heading as the first sentence, no summary paragraph that repeats what
  the reader just read.
- **W-3** Lead a section with the thing itself, not with a warm-up. The first
  sentence should be the definition, the rule, or the number — not "In this
  section we will look at…".
- **W-4** Second person, present tense. The reader is doing the analysis:
  "you discount each year's cash flow", not "the analyst discounts…".
- **W-5** Define a term the first time it appears, in the same sentence, then
  use it plainly afterwards. No glossary detours mid-explanation.

## E — Page elements

The block vocabulary. Each block exists for one job; using the wrong one is a
correctness problem, not a taste problem.

| Block | Its job |
|-------|---------|
| `p` | Prose. The explanation. |
| `h2` | A named idea inside a section. |
| `ul` | Genuinely unordered, parallel items. |
| `callout` | One boxed sentence that must survive when everything else is forgotten. |
| `formula` | A display equation, with its symbols named underneath. |
| `table` | Anything with columns — workings, comparisons, waterfalls. |
| `playground` | Runnable code. Not used in finance courses. |

- **E-1** A financial waterfall (FCF build-up, NPV workings, cumulative payback)
  is a `table` with right-aligned amounts — never a `ul` of "Revenue X, Costs
  (X)". The whole point is that the numbers line up.
- **E-2** Every `formula` names its symbols in `where`. A formula whose letters
  aren't defined on the same screen is decoration.
- **E-3** One `callout` per section, at most. It carries the single sentence
  that closes the loop on that section. More than one and none of them land.
- **E-4** Negative amounts render in brackets — `(24,000)` — not with a minus
  sign. This is the convention the ZCAS lectures and every exam script use.
- **E-5** Money is `ZMW` with thousands separators. State the unit in the
  column header (`ZMW'000`) rather than repeating it in every cell.
- **E-6** Carried subtotals in a working go in `subtotals` (row indices), and
  the figure the working was building towards goes in `total`. Both get a rule
  above them and are set in ink — the way a working is ruled off on paper. Never
  fake a subtotal by bolding text inside a cell.
- **E-7** Steps run on the ZCAS lecture's own worked examples wherever the
  lecture has one, at its original figures, so a student can hold the step and
  the slide side by side. Where a slide contains an arithmetic error, use the
  correct figure and record the correction in the file's header comment.

## S — Structure

- **S-1** *(inherited)* One checkpoint per section — so a section is the unit of
  "I've got this". If a chunk isn't worth a checkpoint, it isn't a section; fold
  it into its neighbour as an `h2`.
- **S-2** A section carries one idea. Two ideas that need two different
  checkpoint questions are two sections.
- **S-3** The first section has no rendered heading (the reader shows the step
  title instead), so it must open the step, not sit as a peer of the others.
- **S-4** Write a `check` for every section. A checkpoint without one falls back
  to self-marked "done", which defeats the point — the reader is meant to
  demonstrate the idea, not assert it.
- **S-5** A check's wrong options must be wrong for a *reason a student would
  actually get wrong* — the common slip, not a nonsense number. `explain` says
  why the right answer is right, in one or two sentences.
- **S-6** *(inherited)* No course skeleton inside a step. Don't list the other
  steps; the sidebar already does that.

## C — Content

- **C-1** *(inherited)* Every example uses ZMW and Zambian companies — Zanaco,
  Zambeef, ZESCO, First Quantum, Airtel Zambia, LuSE-listed names.
- **C-2** Cover what the ZCAS lecture covers, at the depth the lecture and its
  practice questions demand. The step is exam preparation; an idea the lecturer
  spent four slides on cannot become one sentence.
- **C-3** Where the lecture works a numeric example, the step works one too —
  with the arithmetic visible, so the reader can follow each line rather than
  trusting the answer.
- **C-4** Keep the lecture's notation and method names (DPP, MIRR, PBIT) so the
  step and the exam paper speak the same language, even where a clearer term
  exists.
