# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Project Is

**Booklesss** is a Slack-based edtech platform delivering branded PDF study materials for Zambian university finance/business courses. The core pipeline: source material (PPTX/PDF) → Python ReportLab script → PDF → posted to Slack channels. No web framework, no database — just Python scripts and structured content.

**Active courses:** Strategic Management (ZCAS), Treasury Management BBF4302 (ZCAS), Corporate Finance BAC4301 (ZCAS — channels not yet created; do not post until channels exist), BBA 1110 (UNZA)
**Platform:** Slack workspace `bookless10.slack.com` | Website: `booklesss.framer.ai`
**Founding rate deadline:** April 18, 2026 — **this date has passed.** Do not reference it in new marketing content; ask the owner what offer replaces it.

## Commands

**Generate a PDF:**
```bash
python3 "Schools/[School]/[Course]/[lesson]/sources/build_[course]_[step]_[slug].py"
```

**Transcribe a video lecture:**
```bash
python3 _dev/transcribe.py "path/to/video.mp4"
```

**Bulk-transcribe a folder of videos:**
```bash
python3 _dev/transcribe_bulk.py "path/to/folder/"
```

No build system, no tests, no linter. Scripts are self-contained.

### Active Course Anatomy

Each active course has this structure — every lesson is self-contained:

```
[Course]/
├── _course.md          ← course status tracker (the single source of truth)
├── 01-[slug]/          ← one lesson = one Slack channel; folder slug = channel slug
│   ├── steps/          ← built PDFs (Step 1.1.pdf, Step 1.2.pdf)
│   ├── sources/        ← source files + build scripts for those steps
│   └── lesson.md       ← step status + note of any external sources
├── 02-[slug]/ …
├── sources/            ← course-wide sources & build scripts (outlines, study pills)
├── assignments/        ← current-semester assignment briefs
└── past-papers/        ← past exam papers (only TM has these so far)
```

Course-level extras (`sources/`, `assignments/`, `past-papers/`) exist only where a course has that material. Course-wide output PDFs (course outline, study pill) sit at the course root.

If a source (e.g. a textbook) feeds multiple lessons it is copied into each. The lesson folder is the unit of truth — everything needed to understand or rebuild its steps lives inside it. External dependencies are noted in `lesson.md`.

### Pipeline Courses

`Schools/UNZA/_pipeline/` holds 13 UNZA courses (DEM 1110, ECN 1115, ECN 1215, GMS 1035, HRM 1015, IRS 1035, MATH 1110, PAM 1025, POL 1015, PSY, SOC 1110, DEV 1150, ECN 2115) plus a `_video-archive/` of lecture videos. These are raw source material — not yet in Booklesss. When a course is moved into Booklesss it gets the full lesson structure and is promoted from `_pipeline/` to an active folder in the school.

**`_pipeline/` and `_textbooks/` are gitignored and exist only on the owner's machine + OneDrive** — they contain files over GitHub's 100 MB limit. Never add them to git. In a fresh clone these folders are absent; that is expected.

## Architecture

### Content Pipeline
Each lesson step gets one Python script that lives in that lesson's `sources/` folder (naming: `build_[course]_[step]_[slug].py`). The script is both the content and the build tool — all text is written directly into the script, which outputs a PDF to the sibling `steps/` folder. There are no intermediate markdown files. Exception: TM Step 1.1 uses the legacy name `build_lesson_1_1_tm.py`.

Each script resolves paths using `_ROOT` (5 levels up to the Booklesss project root) for fonts and brand assets, and `../steps` relative to its own location for output. This keeps the lesson self-contained: open any `sources/` folder and you have the source material, the build script, and one `python3 build_*.py` away from regenerating the PDF.

Scripts are ~700 lines and follow a fixed structure:
1. Font registration — scripts use Windows fonts vendored in `_dev/fonts/` (Parastoo, Aptos, Parkinsans)
2. Color palette constants (per-course)
3. Page geometry (A4, 2.2cm side margins)
4. ReportLab `ParagraphStyle` definitions
5. Canvas callbacks for cover page and body pages (header/footer on every page)
6. Helper functions: `hairline()`, `section()`, `callout()`, `resources_box()`
7. `build()` function that assembles `story[]` and writes the PDF
8. `if __name__ == "__main__": build()`

### Course Visual Identity
Each course has a distinct color system — do not mix them:

| Course | School | Cover BG | Accent | Display Font |
|--------|--------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Strategic Management | ZCAS | `#0F1F35` slate-navy | `#DC2626` cardinal red | Parastoo-Bold |
| Treasury Management | ZCAS | `#0B1D3A` deep navy | `#10B981` emerald | Parastoo-Bold |
| Corporate Finance | ZCAS | `#FFFEF2` cream | `#2FB99A` jade | Parastoo-Bold |
| Business Administration | UNZA | `#1C2526` dark slate-charcoal | `#F59E0B` amber gold | Parastoo-Bold |

### PDF Content Structure (All Lessons)
Every PDF follows this sequence: cover → 4–7 content sections → 2 embedded discussion questions → Key Terms table → Learning Outcomes → Community closer. Section headers always use an eyebrow tag (7pt bold ALL CAPS, accent color) above the H2. Body text is 10.5pt, leading 17pt.

### Community CTA Pattern
No hard CTAs. Two discussion questions embedded mid-content. Guide the reader toward the next step by weaving a natural hint into the body at the point where it's relevant — never a labelled "Next:" pointer.

### Step Cross-References
When a step's content references another step (e.g. "Step 2.1"), keep the reference as **plain text** — do not link it to a Slack file URL. Slack assigns a new unpredictable file ID on every upload, so embedded file links go stale immediately (see PROJECT_MEMORY dead end, 2026-06-04). Older scripts may still carry a `STEP_LINKS` dict and `step_ref()` helper — remove them when touching those scripts. External permanent links (NotebookLM) are fine.

### Cover ADDED VALUE Box
Each step cover has an accent-bordered "ADDED VALUE" panel listing companion resources as clickable links (NotebookLM audio overviews, linked steps, etc.). Uses the `resources_box([(label, url), ...])` helper defined in each script.

### Lead Magnets
3–4 page PDF teasers for WhatsApp marketing. File name format: `[Hook Title] - Booklesss.pdf`. Use Zambian companies (Zanaco, Zambeef, ZESCO, First Quantum) and ZMW currency in examples. Check `Operations/pricing-strategy.md` for the current offer before writing any pricing or deadline into a lead magnet.

### Skills (Claude Code Extensions)
Three custom skills in `.claude/skills/`, one per phase of the pipeline:
- **`lesson-skill`** — PLAN. Course architecture: takes a course's raw source, groups topics into lessons by mental frame (lesson = one Slack channel = noise isolation), sets steps-per-lesson by source depth, and emits `_course.md`, the folder scaffold, the channel map, and the course outline PDF. Runs before any writing.
- **`step-skill`** — WRITE + DESIGN. The PDF design system (colors, typography, callout specs) *and* the lesson-writing process (source → ReportLab script → PDF). Invoke for all PDF content — lesson steps, lead magnets, business documents. (Absorbed the former `booklesss-write` skill.)
- **`design-system`** — Web/UI only (Framer, landing pages). Not for PDF work.

### Transcription
`_dev/transcribe.py` uses OpenAI Whisper (`small.en` model). Outputs `[video-name]_transcript.md` alongside the source video. Skips files already transcribed. Source video collection is in `Schools/UNZA/_pipeline/_video-archive/` (ECO 155 macroeconomics, MIT 14.01SC microeconomics).

## Writing Style Rules (Enforced in All Content)

Banned words: "tapestry", "nuance", "multifaceted", "robust", "delve", "foster", "Furthermore", "It's worth noting", "landscape", "journey", "empower", "leverage" (as verb), "game-changer", "seamless", "holistic", "synergy". All examples use ZMW (Zambian kwacha) and local companies.
