> **Source gaps:** Steps 1.2, 6.1, and 8.1 have no dedicated lecture — draw from the
> general notes (`BBA 1110 NOTES.pdf`, `BBA 1110 BATCH NOTES.pdf`) carried in each
> lesson's `sources/`.
>
> **Note:** source sub-folders still carry their original UNZA lecture numbering
> ("Lesson 3", "Lesson 4", …). That is raw-source provenance, not the Booklesss
> lesson number — the mapping above is authoritative.
